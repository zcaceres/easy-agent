## Todo

Next:
  - dependency injection for logger and other implicit deps inside classes
  - bundle as proper library
  - update readme for use as library and as project boilerplate
  - make library example
  - big tool library
  - tag tools individually for caching

Future:

- Stateful server mode
- Vision
- Clean up Anthropic lifecycle process function a bit
- refactor out rendering logic from client to a CLI-oriented module, so that I can break out the message lifecycle from the rendering for server use
- handle 429 issues

```
