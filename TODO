## Todo
- [] Make sure you can pause recording so you can read to figure out the next thing you're gonna say.
    - [] press enter to continue
- [] The keyboard handlers inside the recording module are flaky. They appear to register more than once and it makes it impossible to kill the process and duplicates logs.

- ideas
    - figure out why google speech to text doesn't work.. not even their boilerplate one
    - do VOSK
    - do DeepSpeech

- [] Voice support
    - [] README update with TOC
    - [] README update with voice

- [] Add Gemini support
    - Gemini has a couple things that it seems better at.

Future:
- refactor out rendering logic from client to a CLI-oriented module, so that I can break out the message lifecycle from the rendering for server use
- tag tools individually for caching
- Vision
- handle 429 issues
