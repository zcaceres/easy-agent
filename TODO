## Todo

GOAL
- Take this framework live top NPM
   - take ai project manager live (based on published NPM package)
- Adding Gemini support
    - Gemini has a couple things that it seems better at.

Next:
- bundle as proper library
- make library example


Future:
- refactor out rendering logic from client to a CLI-oriented module, so that I can break out the message lifecycle from the rendering for server use
- tag tools individually for caching
- Vision
- handle 429 issues

```
429 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"rate_limit_error","message":"Number of request tokens has exceeded your per-minute rate limit (https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/rate-limits); see the response headers for current usage.

You may also contact sales at https://www.anthropic.com/contact-sales to discuss your options for a rate limit increase."}}
