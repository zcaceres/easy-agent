## Todo

Next:

- Use only Session History or Message Log, not both!
    - dependency injection for logger and other implicit deps inside classes
- refactor out rendering logic from client to a CLI-oriented module, so that I can break out the message lifecycle from the rendering for server use
- bundle as proper library
- make library example
- tag tools individually for caching

Future:

- Vision
- Clean up Anthropic lifecycle process function a bit
- handle 429 issues

```
