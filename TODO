WHY WON'T GCLOUD TURN THE AUDIO STREAM INTO A TRANSCRIPT?
- ideas
    - do VOSK
    - do DeepSpeech
    - figure out why google speech to text doesn't work.. not even their local one

We have stubbed in basic voice support.
We know we can RECORD voice.
We know in principle that we can get a transcript... from somewhere.
And we know that we can pass this transcript as input to the agent as long as we turn it into a striong.

- [] Voice support
    - [] README update with TOC
    - [] README update with voice

- [] Add Gemini support
    - Gemini has a couple things that it seems better at.

Future:
- refactor out rendering logic from client to a CLI-oriented module, so that I can break out the message lifecycle from the rendering for server use
- tag tools individually for caching
- Vision
- handle 429 issues
